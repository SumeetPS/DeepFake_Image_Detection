# DeepFake Image Detection Project

## Overview

This repository contains code for a DeepFake Image Detection project. The project includes a Python script for training a convolutional neural network (CNN) to detect deepfake images and a Flask web application for real-time deepfake detection using the trained model.


## How to Use

### Training the Model

1. Run the Python Notebook script to train the deepfake detection model.
2. The trained model will be saved in the same directory.

### Running the Web Application

1. Run the Flask application using the command `python app.py`.
2. Upload an image to the web application to perform real-time deepfake detection.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow
- Keras
- Flask
- Other dependencies can be installed using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
